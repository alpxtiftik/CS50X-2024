To characterize the audio aura of a listener based on their top 100 songs from 2018, we would consider several factors:

Energy: This reflects the intensity and activity level of the music. High-energy songs typically have fast tempos, loud dynamics, and strong beats.

Valence: Valence measures the positivity or negativity of the music. Positive songs tend to have uplifting melodies and lyrics, while negative songs may be more melancholic or somber.

Danceability: This indicates how suitable the music is for dancing based on factors like tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.

Using these metrics, we can derive an average energy, valence, and danceability score for the listener's top 100 songs from 2018. This would provide insights into the overall mood and vibe of the music they enjoy.

However, this method might not be fully representative of the listener's audio aura for several reasons:

Variety of Mood: The top 100 songs may not accurately represent the listener's full spectrum of moods. They might have certain favorite songs that skew the results towards a particular mood, while other songs they enjoy might not make it to the top 100.

Temporal Bias: The listener's mood and musical preferences could have evolved throughout the year. Their top songs from early in the year might reflect a different mood compared to those from later in the year.

Subjectivity: The interpretation of energy, valence, and danceability can be subjective. What one person considers high-energy or positive might differ from another person's perspective.

To improve the accuracy and representativeness of the audio aura calculation, Spotify could consider the following approaches:

Dynamic Analysis: Instead of relying solely on the top 100 songs, Spotify could analyze the listener's entire listening history from 2018. This would provide a more comprehensive view of their musical preferences and mood variations over time.

Contextual Data: Incorporating additional data such as listening habits at different times of the day or week, user-generated playlists, and skipping behavior could provide more context to understand the listener's mood and preferences.

Personalization: Utilizing machine learning algorithms to personalize the calculation of audio aura based on individual listening patterns and feedback over time. This could lead to more accurate and tailored insights for each user.

By considering a broader range of data and incorporating more sophisticated analysis techniques, Spotify could enhance the accuracy and relevance of the audio aura feature, providing users with deeper insights into their musical preferences and mood patterns.
